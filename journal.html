        Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
        <ul>
            <li>Walla Walla, WA,</li>
            <li>Magic City, ID,</li>
            <li>Bountiful, UT,</li>
            <li>Last Chance, CO,</li>
            <li>Why, AZ</li>
            <li>and Truth or Consequences, NM.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
        <blockquote>
        "Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."
        </blockquote>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars.

    My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,
        <q>"A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</q>
